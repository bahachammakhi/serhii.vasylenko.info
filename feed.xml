A smart guess, huh? Configuration Management Native Apple’s Mobile device management (a.k.a MDM) and Jamf is probably the most potent combination for macOS configuration. But as much as it’s mighty, it is a cumbersome com... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Terraforming mac1.metal at AWS</title><link href="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/20/terraforming-mac1-metal-at-AWS.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Terraforming mac1.metal at AWS" /><published>2021-01-20T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-01-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/20/terraforming-mac1-metal-at-AWS.html</id> <content src="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/20/terraforming-mac1-metal-at-AWS.html" /> <author> <name>Serhii Vasylenko</name> </author> <category term="Technical Blogs" /> <summary> Recently AWS announced the support for Mac mini instances. I believe this is huge, even despite the many constraints this solution has. Oh, and the price is as huge as the announcement as well. But still, this offering opens the door to seamless macOS CI/CD integration into existing AWS infrastructure. Here is a tip for engineers like me who decided to give this new instance type a try: mana... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>mac1.metal EC2 Instance — user experience</title><link href="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/19/mac1-metal-EC2-Instance-user-experience.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="mac1.metal EC2 Instance — user experience" /><published>2021-01-19T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2021-01-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/19/mac1-metal-EC2-Instance-user-experience.html</id> <content src="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2021/01/19/mac1-metal-EC2-Instance-user-experience.html" /> <author> <name>Serhii Vasylenko</name> </author> <category term="Review" /> <summary> Amazon EC2 Mac Instances Something cool and powerful with inevitable trade-offs. As everything in this world. AWS announced EC2 macOS-based instances on the 30th of November 2020, and after more than a month of tests, I would like to share some findings and impressions about it. First of all, the things you can easily find, but it’s still worth to say: The new instance family is called ma... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>AWS CloudShell</title><link href="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2020/12/16/aws-cloudshell.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AWS CloudShell" /><published>2020-12-16T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2020-12-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2020/12/16/aws-cloudshell.html</id> <content src="https://serhii.vasylenko.info/2020/12/16/aws-cloudshell.html" /> <author> <name>Serhii Vasylenko</name> </author> <category term="Review" /> <summary> A simple but cool announcement from AWS — AWS CloudShell. A tool for ad-hoc AWS management via CLI directly in your browser. I like when AWS releases something simple to understand and yet powerful. So it is not another DevOps Guru, believe me :) Yes, this is similar to the shells that GCE and Azure have. No, you can’t access your instances from it, so it’s not a jump server (bastion hos... </summary> </entry> </feed>
